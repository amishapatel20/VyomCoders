# VyomCoders
# 🔥 VyoMCoders – Forest Fire Forecasting & Spread Simulation Platform  
## Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon 2025 Submission

---

### 🧩 Problem Statement  
**Simulation/Modelling of Forest Fire Spread using AI/ML techniques**

---

### 🌍 Project Summary  
**VyoMCoders** presents a terrain-aware, AI-powered system for **proactive forest fire prediction** and **dynamic spread simulation**, built specifically for India's ecologically diverse forest regions. Unlike traditional fire detection tools, our system forecasts **where and how fires may start and spread**—empowering authorities with **preventive intelligence**.

---

### 🔍 Key Features  
- ✅ **Daily Fire Risk Forecasts** using real-time terrain, vegetation, and meteorological data  
- ✅ **1–12 Hour Spread Simulation** leveraging slope, wind, and fuel availability  
- ✅ **SHAP-based Explainability** to interpret and trust risk predictions  
- ✅ **Live Satellite Integration** (MODIS, FIRMS, NDVI, LST, DEM)  
- ✅ **Lightweight Web Interface** suitable for dashboards and field devices  
- ✅ **Human Activity Risk Mapping** near villages, farms, and roads

---

### 🤖 Dual AI Engine  
- **U-Net** → Spatial fire risk segmentation  
- **ConvLSTM** → Temporal fire spread forecasting  
- **Focal Loss + Augmentation** → Robustness against class imbalance and rare events  
- **SHAP (XAI)** → Local and global interpretability of model predictions

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV  
- **AI/ML Tools**: SHAP, Focal Loss, U-Net, ConvLSTM  
- **Remote Sensing APIs**: MODIS, FIRMS, DEM  
- **Interface**: Flask / Streamlit  
- **Optional**: Google Earth Engine (for advanced geospatial processing)
